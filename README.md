# extfix
Fixes or converts specified file extensions to a different one.
- i.e. `file.png` -> `file.jpg`

# Requirements

# How To Use
1. Download `extfix.py`.
2. Edit `extfix.py` with a text editor.
  - `FOLDER_NAME` = The directory path with all the files to be fixed.
    - If you do not know what you are doing, just create a folder in the same directory as `extfix.py` (but don't put `extfix.py` in the created folder).
      - Either name the folder `Test` or whatever you set the `FOLDER_NAME` to.
    - INSERT IMAGE
  - `TARGET_EXT` = the extension you want to be replaced.
    - i.e. `file.png` -> `file.jpg` then you would put `.png`.
  - `NEW_EXT` = the new extension to replace with.
    - i.e. `file.png` -> `file.jpg` then you would put `.jpg`.
3. Run `extfix.py` and it should work!
